# Onedroid
An all in one android app


This aim of this app is to incorporate all the front-end components of the android platform, ranging from widgets like buttons,
to containers and layouts. Each component has an activity to show the graphical representation, theoretical information, and
common methods. 
Most of the work is populating the theory and methods of these components. The theory will be based on these two links:

1. https://developer.android.com/index.html
2. https://www.dropbox.com/s/5tuhlz887x876wb/The%20Busy%20Coder%27s%20Guide%20to%20Android%20Development%20Version%208.2.pdf?dl=0

I need all the help I can get.
